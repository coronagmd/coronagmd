          What are all the different coat colors & patterns?
        </h2>
        <ul class="Bernedoodle-colors">
          <p>All come in a beautiful array of colors and patterns!</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>SOLID</li>
          <p>
            - If the dog's coat is all the same color, it is qualified as solid.
            Occasionally, a solid colored puppy will have a small white marking,
            generally on it's chest or toes. These markings are 'abstract' and
            do not disqualify the dog from being a solid color.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>PARTI</li>
          <p>
            - If 30%+ of the dog's body is white, it is considered a parti
            color. Parti colors should not fade.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>PHANTOM</li>
          <p>
            - Phantom refers to a dog's markings and phantom marking is similar
            to that of a rottweiler or doberman. Phantom colored goldendoodles,
            poodles, and bernedoodles generally have lighter colored markings on
            their eyebrows, chests, and legs. Phantom coloring can sometimes
            blend into the dog's coat and become less distinct as the dog grows.
            Phantom can be combined with parti, sable, or brindle coat colors.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>SABLE</li>
          <p>
            - Sable is a mixture of grey, brown, and black colorings and can
            sometimes turn out looking brindle when the dog's coat is shaved
            down.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>BRINDLE</li>
          <p>
            - It's generally easiest to tell if a dog is brindle when shaved
            down. It's coat will look almost tiger-striped, generally grey,
            black, and/or brown.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>TRI-COLORED</li>
          <p>
            - A puppy is a tri if it is black with distinct white chest and
            brown eyebrow leg markings.

            <li>Step #2 Get approved</li>
            <p>
              I will be calling or emailing you to better find which puppy will
              best fit your needs and situation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Step #3 Put a deposit down</li>
            <p>
              The deposit is $400 and will hold your space for a puppy. If the
              puppy you are looking for is not in the current littler you will
              remain in line for the next litter.

            <li>Step #4 Puppy Picking</li>
            <p>
              At week 6 you will be sent a puppy personality page on each of the
              puppies. You will be requested to choose your top three. We will
              then pair each puppy up with its prospective family.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Step #5 Prepare your home for a new puppy</li>
            <p>
              It is fun to have a new puppy in your home but there are
              somethings you might need to change and items you will want to
              gather for your new family member to have the best start off they
              can. I will send you an email with a checklist we recommend.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Step #6 Payments Due</li>
            <p>
              When Puppies are 8 weeks old the payments are due in full. We can
              collect payment through an online app or we also recommend you
              find us on Good Dog and pay through their excellent website.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Step #7 Pick up Puppies <br /></li>
            <p>
              8 weeks old puppies are ready to go home and officially join your
              family! Make sure you have used the checklist of items to ensure
              you have completed prior to your puppy departing our home. Now -
              the real fun begins!

            What is the Golden Mountain Doodle Lifespan?
          </h2>
          <p class="faq-lifespan">
            While this can be hard to predict due to the young nature of the
            breed, Poodles have a longer lifespan. Bernese Mountain dogs have
            depressingly short ones. Just like health issues, a dog's life is
            improved through being crossbred.
          </p>

          <p class="faq-lifespan">
            A lot can be assumed from their lineage. Using this information, the
            Golden Mountain Doodle will have a lifespan of about an average of
            10 to 13 years. With few to no health issues, they should be
            expected to live about 15 to 16 years.
          </p>
          <p class="faq-lifespan">
            No matter what, every year with them will be special.

        <h4 class="black-text">Gentle and affectionate</h4>
        <p>
          This amazing breed is playful, affectionate, family loving dogs. They
          have both the stamina to keep up with an athlete, but are just as
          happy to lay on the couch all day and chill. Golden Mountain Doodles
          are good for first-time dog owners. Our puppies are raised among
          family members to aid smooth transitioning and great socialization.
          This is to help them bend easily into their new home as they are
          already used to the family environment.

        <h4 class="black-text">Intelligent and trainable</h4>
        <p>
          Golden Mountain Doodles are intelligent and eager to please, which
          makes them relatively easy to train. However, it is important to start
          their training at an early age and focus on basic obedience,
          socialization, and good manners. This breed responds well to positive
          reinforcement techniques such as treats, praises, or play.

        <img src="images/paw.png" alt="Paw print" class="feature-icon" />

        <h4 class="black-text">Hypoallergenic</h4>
        <p>
          Golden Mountain Doodles have a thick coat that can be wavy, curly, or
          straight all of which requires regular brushing to prevent mats and
          tangles. Depending on the coat type they are low to moderate shedders.
          Regular grooming is not just about maintaining their appearance but
          also about ensuring their skin and coat health. Frequent brushing will
          help distribute natural oils, promoting a healthy coat and reducing
          shedding.
