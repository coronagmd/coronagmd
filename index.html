        The Golden Mountain Doodle is a relatively new breed. They were only
        introduced in 2013. The Golden Mountain Doodle is a mix of Golden
        Retriever, Bernese Mountain Dog and Poodle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Poodles are the critical part of this breed. Those who have an allergy
        to dogs will find that the poodle in this breed helps to provide a
        wonderfully hypoallergenic fur that doesn't shed or at least very
        little. Poodles are known to be extremely intelligent, this helps in the
        training of these bright dogs. Poodles do have a downside of being
        obstinate, and head strong that is why we bring in the Bernese Mountain
        Dog.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bernese Mountain Dog greatly adds to the personality traits in a
        Golden Mountain Doodle. They’re easy-going while being mildly active.
        Bernese Mountain Dogs are known for having calm and gentle
        personalities, making them great family pets. Still intelligent, they’re
        also very sociable creatures. You will find this mix of dog will want to
        be very near you and willing to play, while Poodles can be energetic,
        the Bernese Mountain Dog side of this will subdue that hyper edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you stopped there you would have the highly sought after breed of
        Bernedoodle. Bernedoodles inherit a loving nature from both parent
        breeds, making them great family companions and excellent with children.
        Their gentle nature makes them ideal for first-time dog owners or those
        looking for a calm and friendly pet.
      </p>
      <p>
        We finally come to add in the amazing breed of the Golden Retriever. As
        a breed they are known to be energetic and trainable, similar to the
        Poodle. They’re incredible family dogs due to their extreme loyalty.
        They might have a tad more energy than the Bernese Mountain Dog, but
        they are, of course, one of the most popular dogs of all time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Golden Mountain Doodle is the result of breeding a Bernedoodle and a
        Golden Retriever or Goldendoodle together. At Corona Golden Mountain
        Doodle we are aiming to breed dogs that are healthy and have the most of
        their parent breed’s best traits while many of the worst are bred out.
        Doodle breeds, are intelligent and loyal, and adding the coloring and
        wavy coats in this Golden Mountain Doodle you will definitely fall in
        love with this devoted family pet.
